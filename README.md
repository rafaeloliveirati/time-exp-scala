# Build a TimeExpression

You have to implement a TimeExpression using all your knowledge about OOP or FP.

Do the best to pass the tests :) (see `TimeExpressionSpec`).

Take a look the object `TimeExpression` and read the desired behaviour:

### Non-recurring

Just matches a given date, for example: Thursday, February 22, 2018.

### Every X days from one date to another date

Every 3 days from Thursday, February 22, 2018 to March 15, 2018.

### Day Y every X months from a month to another month

On the 8th of each month from January 2018 to August 2019.

### The Y every X months from a month to another month

The 3rd Friday every 2 months from January 2018 to August 2019.

### The Y every X years from a year to another year

On August 8 every year from 2018 to 2024.

### Why do I have to do it ?

We want to see how you design the model of the domain and how you apply TDD as a software development technique

## Note:

You can reify types like `Int` to represent the correct abtractions.
